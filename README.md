# Paper Task

Paper Task is a unique task management web application designed to emulate the simplicity and straightforwardness of managing tasks on paper. With intentional limitations to encourage mindful task management, Paper Task helps users stay organized and focused on what matters most.

## Features

### Paper-like Task Management
- **Immutable Task Completion**: Once a task is marked as completed by clicking on it, it is crossed out and cannot be undone, just like crossing off a task on paper. This intentional limitation encourages users to be more mindful about completing tasks and fosters a sense of commitment to their tasks and goals.
- **No Task Reordering**: Tasks are listed in the order they are created, fostering a conscious approach to task entry and completion.

### Task Lists and Organization
- **Create Multiple Lists**: Organize tasks into different lists to manage various projects or aspects of life. Each list is independent and maintains its own set of tasks.
- **Task Notes**: Add detailed notes to each task to provide additional context or information, ensuring all details are readily accessible in one place.

### Task Prioritization
- **Priority Badges**: Assign priority badges to tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to quickly identify the most important tasks at a glance.
